Day 3: Graph Representation & BFS Introduction
Objective: Learn how to represent graphs + implement BFS (shortest path in unweighted graph).

Theory (1.5 hours)
Graph types: undirected/directed, weighted/unweighted
Adjacency list: vector<vector<int>> adj(n+1);
BFS: queue, visited array, level/distance
Applications: shortest path, connected components
Read: GeeksforGeeks "BFS Traversal in Graph"

Practice (2.5–3 hours)
Program 1: Build undirected graph from edges
Program 2: BFS to find distance from node 1 to all
Codeforces problems (1000–1300 graphs):
263A — Beautiful Matrix (simple manhattan, but graph flavor)
50A — Domino Piling (simple graph thinking)
1549B — Gregor and the Pawn Game (very easy graph)
1944A — Destroying Bridges (graph + greedy)
939A — Love Triangle (cycle detection simple)


Homework/Review
Draw graph for 2–3 problems on paper
Implement BFS template (keep it for future)

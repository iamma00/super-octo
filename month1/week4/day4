Day 4: DFS Basics + Connected Components
Objective: Learn DFS (recursive & stack) + find connected components.

Theory (1–1.5 hours)
DFS recursive vs iterative
Visited array importance (avoid cycles)
Applications: connected components, cycle detection (intro)
BFS vs DFS comparison

Practice (2.5–3 hours)
Program 1: Recursive DFS print nodes
Program 2: Count connected components
Codeforces problems:
58A — Chat room (simple string → graph thinking)
266B — Queue at the School (simulation)
More easy graph: 734A — Anton and Danik (counting)
Try 155A — I_love_%username% (simple max tracking)


Homework
Write DFS + BFS templates side by side

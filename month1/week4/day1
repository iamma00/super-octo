Day 1: Greedy Fundamentals + Sorting-based Greedy
Objective: Understand when & why greedy works + classic sorting greedy patterns.

Theory (1–1.5 hours)
Greedy choice property & optimal substructure
Common greedy patterns:
• Sort + take best/worst
• Interval scheduling
• Fractional knapsack style (but integer version)
• Minimize maximum / maximize minimum
When greedy fails (counterexamples)
Read: GeeksforGeeks "Greedy Algorithms" + "Activity Selection Problem"

Practice (2.5–3.5 hours)
Classic warm-up: Activity Selection (sort by end time)
Codeforces problems (1000–1300):
230A — DragonsApproach: Sort dragons by strength, try to defeat in order, accumulate bonus
158B — TaxiApproach: Greedy grouping of 1,2,3,4 people into taxis
1374C — Move Brackets (constructive greedy)
1360B — Honest Coach (already did — revisit)
1328A — Divisibility Problem
791A — Bear and Big Brother (simple loop greedy)
996A — Hit the Lottery (classic greedy coins)
1342A — Greatest Convex (2025+ similar style)

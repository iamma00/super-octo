Day 7: Heavy Practice + Week Review
Objective: Consolidate & push rating.

Solve 15–20 problems (mix greedy 1200–1400 + graphs 1100–1300)
Re-solve 5 hardest problems from the week without looking at code
Full review:
Update journal with all new patterns
List weak subtopics (e.g., "still slow on greedy proofs")
Prepare cheat-sheet: BFS/DFS templates, common greedy patterns


Week 4 Expected Outcome

Solved ~45–60 problems (mostly 1100–1400)
Comfortable implementing BFS/DFS on grid & simple graphs
Can recognize & implement classic greedy patterns
Rating in virtual contests approaching 1400–1500
Ready for dynamic programming introduction in Month 3

You're now entering the most important phase — consistency + upsolving will decide whether you reach Candidate Master in 6 months. Good luck! Keep grinding!

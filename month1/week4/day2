Day 2: Advanced Greedy + Greedy with Two Pointers / Binary Search
Objective: Tackle harder greedy that requires sorting + additional logic.

Theory (1 hour)
Greedy + two pointers
Greedy + binary search on answer (minimize maximum type)
Proof sketches (why this greedy is correct)

Practice (3–4 hours)
Codeforces problems (1200–1400 greedy):
1367B — Even Array
1451A — Subtract or Divide
1520B — Same Parity Summands
1632A — ABC (very recent style)
2176C — Circles Are Far from Each Other (~1300, recent)
2169C — Recent problem (~1300, greedy flavor)
2181B — Yet Another MEX Problem (1400-ish greedy)
1825B — Make It Increasing (classic minimize max diff)
2144B — Maximum Cost Permutation (greedy construction)

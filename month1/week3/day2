Day 2: Binary Search
Objective: Learn efficient searching – crucial for problems with sorted data.

Theory (1.5 hours):
Linear search: O(n), bad for large n
Binary search: O(log n) on sorted array
std::lower_bound() and std::upper_bound()
Implement binary search manually (important for understanding)
Variants: Find first/last occurrence, minimum/maximum satisfying condition
Read: GeeksforGeeks “Binary Search in C++ STL” and “Implement Binary Search”

Practice (2–3 hours):
Program 1: Manual binary search to find if element exists
Program 2: Use lower_bound to find first >= x
Program 3: Count occurrences of x using lower_bound and upper_bound
Full Problems:
Codeforces: 706B – “Interesting drink”
Approach: Sort prices, then for each query use upper_bound to count how many ≤ m
Ways to deal: Pre-sort, then binary search per query
Codeforces: 1353B – “Two Arrays And Swaps” (binary search optional)
LeetCode: “Binary Search” (704)


Homework/Review:
Draw binary search tree for array of 10 elements

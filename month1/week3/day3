Day 3: Basic Math – GCD, LCM, Prime Checking
Objective: Master number-theoretic basics used in many problems.

Theory (1.5 hours):
GCD: Euclidean algorithm (std::gcd in C++17+)
LCM: (a*b)/gcd(a,b) — careful with overflow
Prime check: Trial division up to sqrt(n)
Sieve of Eratosthenes: Precompute primes up to 10^6
Read: GeeksforGeeks “GCD in C++”, “Prime Numbers”, “Sieve of Eratosthenes”

Practice (2–3 hours):
Program 1: Compute GCD and LCM of two numbers
Program 2: Check if number is prime (trial division)
Program 3: Generate all primes up to 10^5 using sieve
Full Problems:
Codeforces: 4C – “Registration system” (math not directly, but hash-like)
Codeforces: 546D – “Soldier and Bananas” (simple math)
Codeforces: 1353A – “Most Unstable Array” (math)
Codeforces: 1359A – “Berland Poker” (math)


Homework/Review:
Implement sieve for 10^6, count primes

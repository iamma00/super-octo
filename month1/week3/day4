Day 4: Time Complexity and Optimization
Objective: Learn to analyze and improve solution speed.

Theory (1.5 hours):
Big-O notation: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)
Loop analysis: Nested loops → O(n²)
Common pitfalls: TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) when n=10^5 and O(n²)
Optimization: Use fast input, avoid unnecessary operations
Read: GeeksforGeeks “Time Complexity Analysis”

Practice (2 hours):
Program 1: Compare O(n²) vs O(n log n) by timing (use clock())
Program 2: Optimize prime check using sieve
Full Problems:
Codeforces: 231A – “Team” (simple, but think about time)
Codeforces: 136A – “Presents” (O(n))


Homework/Review:
Analyze time complexity of previous problems

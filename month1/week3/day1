Day 1: Sorting Algorithms (Focus on std::sort)
Objective: Understand why sorting is powerful and master the built-in sorting function.

Theory (1–1.5 hours):
Why sort? Many problems become easier after sorting (e.g., finding duplicates, two-pointer techniques).
Built-in sort: sort(arr.begin(), arr.end()); or sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater<int>());
Time complexity: O(n log n) average/worst case
Comparison-based vs non-comparison (we'll stick to std::sort)
Sorting custom types: pairs, structs with comparator
Read: GeeksforGeeks “std::sort() in C++” and “Sorting Algorithms” (focus on quicksort intro)

Practice (2–3 hours):
Program 1: Sort vector of ints ascending and descending
Program 2: Sort vector of pairs by first ascending, second descending
Program 3: Sort array of structs {name, score}
Program 4: Count frequency after sorting (group same elements)
Full Problems from Sites:
Codeforces: 1360B – “Honest Coach”
Approach: Sort the array, find minimum difference between consecutive elements
Ways to deal: Use vector<int>, sort, iterate i=1 to n-1, track min diff
Codeforces: 1328B – “Divisibility Problem” (sort optional but useful)
HackerRank: “Closest Numbers” – Sort and find min difference


Homework/Review (45 minutes):
Journal: Explain why std::sort is O(n log n), when to use custom comparator
Extra: Codeforces 451A – “Games” (simple sort + count)

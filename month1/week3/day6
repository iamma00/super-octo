Day 6: Virtual Contest Preparation
Objective: Get ready for timed contests.

Theory (1 hour):
Virtual contest rules: 2 hours, 5–7 problems, submit on Codeforces
Strategy: Solve easy first (A, B), then harder

Practice (3 hours):
Choose an old Div. 3 or Div. 4 contest (e.g., Codeforces Round #800 Div. 3)
Solve as many as possible in 2 hours (aim for 3–4)

Homework/Review:
Upsolve remaining problems

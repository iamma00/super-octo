Day 5: Pointers and References (Light Introduction)
Objective: Understand basics – needed for understanding STL internals and later advanced topics.

Theory (1 hour):
Pointer: int* p = &x;, *p dereference.
Reference: int &ref = x; alias.
Why in CP: References for efficiency, pointers less common.
Avoid deep pointer arithmetic this week.
Read: GeeksforGeeks “Pointers in C++” (basics only).

Practice (2 hours):
Program 1: Pointer declaration, dereference.
Program 2: Swap using pointers.
Program 3: Function taking pointer parameter.
Full Problems: Skip heavy pointer problems; focus on references in functions.

Homework/Review: Note difference between & (address) and & (reference).

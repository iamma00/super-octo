Day 1: Vectors – The Dynamic Array
Objective: Master std::vector – the most important container in competitive programming (resizable, easy to use).

Theory (1–1.5 hours):
Why vectors? Unlike fixed arrays, vectors grow dynamically.
Include: #include <vector>
Declaration: vector<int> v; or vector<long long> v(n, 0); (size n, initialized to 0).
Key operations:
v.push_back(x); – add to end
v.pop_back(); – remove last
v.size(); – current size
v.empty(); – check empty
Access: v[i] (0-based), v.front(), v.back()
Iteration: for-loop, range-based for(for(auto &x : v)), iterators
v.clear();, v.resize(n);

Read: GeeksforGeeks “Vector in C++ STL” (full article with examples).
Video: The Cherno “C++ Vectors” or freeCodeCamp segment (15–20 mins).

Practice (2–3 hours):
Program 1: Basic vector operations – Declare vector, push 5 numbers, print size and elements.
Program 2: Read n, then read n integers into vector, output in reverse.
Program 3: Find maximum element in vector (use loop, then try *max_element(v.begin(), v.end())).
Program 4: Sum of vector elements using range-based for.
Program 5: Remove duplicates (simple way: use another vector and check existence).
Full Problems from Sites:
HackerRank: “Vector-Sort” – Read n, push into vector, sort with sort(v.begin(), v.end()), print.
Approach: Use vector<int> v; for(int i=0; i<n; i++){int x; cin>>x; v.push_back(x);} then sort and print.

HackerRank: “Vector-Erase” – Practice erase operations (v.erase(v.begin()+i);, range erase).
Approach: Follow exact instructions for erase queries.

LeetCode: “Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array” (26) – Easy version with vector.
Approach: Two pointers or use new vector.



Homework/Review (45 minutes):
Re-run all programs with large n (10^5) to see speed.
Journal: 4 key points (e.g., “push_back is O(1) amortized”), 2 bugs encountered (e.g., “accessed v[ v.size() ] → out of bounds”).
Extra: Solve Codeforces 1462A – “Favorite Sequence” (uses vector reverse and simple logic).

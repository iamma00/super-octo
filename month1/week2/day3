Day 3: Functions (Advanced) – Parameters, Return, Overloading
Objective: Deepen understanding of functions – pass by reference, multiple returns via pair.

Theory (1.5 hours):
Pass by value vs reference (&).
Returning multiple values: return pair or use reference parameters.
Function overloading (same name, different params).
Default arguments (rare in CP).
Read: GeeksforGeeks “Functions in C++” advanced part.

Practice (2–3 hours):
Program 1: Swap two numbers using reference.
Program 2: Function that returns pair {min, max} of two numbers.
Program 3: Overloaded function for sum of 2 and 3 integers.
Full Problems:
HackerRank: “Functions” (already done, revisit).
Codeforces: 231A – “Team” – Simple function to count solvable problems.


Homework/Review: Refactor Week 1 code to use functions properly.

Day 4: Recursion Basics
Objective: Understand recursion – crucial for later DP and tree problems.

Theory (1.5 hours):
Base case + recursive case.
Stack overflow risk (keep depth small initially).
Examples: factorial, Fibonacci, power.
Read: GeeksforGeeks “Recursion in C++”.

Practice (2–3 hours):
Program 1: Recursive factorial.
Program 2: Recursive power(x,n).
Program 3: Print numbers 1 to n recursively.
Full Problems:
LeetCode: “Fibonacci Number” (509) – Recursive (accept slow).
Codeforces: 118A – “String Task” (can be iterative, but practice recursion elsewhere).


Homework/Review: Draw recursion tree for factorial(4).

Day 2: Pairs and Sorting Basics
Objective: Learn pair<int,int> and basic sorting – essential for many problems.

Theory (1–1.5 hours):
Include: #include <utility> (usually included with others).
Declaration: pair<int,int> p = {1,2}; or make_pair(1,2);
Access: p.first, p.second
Vector of pairs: vector<pair<int,int>> vp;
Sorting: sort(v.begin(), v.end()); works for vectors of int, pair (sorts by first, then second), strings.
Custom sort: lambda or comparator (intro only).
Read: GeeksforGeeks “Pair in C++ STL” and “Sort in C++ STL”.
Video: Search “C++ pair and sorting”.

Practice (2–3 hours):
Program 1: Create vector<pair<int,int>>, push several pairs, print.
Program 2: Sort vector of integers (ascending and descending with greater<int>()).
Program 3: Sort vector of pairs by first ascending, then second descending.
Program 4: Read n points (x,y), sort by x.
Full Problems:
Codeforces: 1360A – “Minimal Square” – Use pair or simple math.
Approach: Given a,b → side = max(2*min(a,b), max(a,b)).

Codeforces: 158A – “Next Round” – Simple vector + sort optional.
LeetCode: “Sort Array By Parity” (905) – Easy sorting practice.


Homework/Review:
Journal sorting rules for pairs.
Extra: Codeforces 112A – “Petya and Strings” (case-insensitive compare).

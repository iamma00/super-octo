Day 1: Setting Up and Basic Variables/Data Types
Objective: Install and configure your coding environment, understand how to store and manipulate basic data using variables and types. This builds the groundwork for all future coding by teaching data representation.

Setup (30-45 minutes):
Download and install VS Code from code.visualstudio.com.
Install compiler: For Windows, download MinGW from mingw-w64.org and add to PATH; for Mac, use Xcode Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install); for Linux, install g++ via sudo apt install g++.
Configure VS Code: Install "C/C++" extension by Microsoft; create a new file "hello.cpp" with code: #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << "Hello World"; return 0; }.
Test compilation: In terminal (integrated in VS Code), run g++ hello.cpp -o hello then ./hello. If errors, troubleshoot by searching "g++ not found" or watch a setup video.
Point-to-point tips: Ensure PATH is set correctly (verify with g++ --version); use a simple folder structure for files (e.g., create a "cpp-practice" folder).

Theory: Variables and Data Types (1-1.5 hours):
Variables: Named memory locations to store data; must be declared before use.
Data Types:
int: Integers, e.g., 42, -7; 4 bytes, range -2147483648 to 2147483647.
float: Single-precision floating-point, e.g., 3.14; less accurate for decimals.
double: Double-precision floating-point, e.g., 3.1415926535; use for precise decimals.
char: Single character, e.g., 'A'; enclosed in single quotes.
string: Sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello"; requires #include <string>.
bool: Boolean values, true (1) or false (0).

Declaration and Initialization: type name = value; (e.g., int count = 0;).
Constants: const type name = value; (unchangeable, e.g., const double PI = 3.14159;).
Operators: Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, % for modulo).
Read: GeeksforGeeks "C++ Data Types" (full section, note examples); "Variables in C++" (understand scope basics, but focus on local variables).
Video: Watch freeCodeCamp "C++ Variables and Data Types" (15 mins).
Notes: Take point-to-point notes, e.g., "Modulo %: 10 % 3 = 1; useful for remainders."

Practice (2-3 hours):
Program 1: Declare and print variables – Create "variables.cpp": Declare one of each type (int age=25; double height=5.9; etc.), use cout << "Age: " << age << endl; for output. Approach: Use separate lines for clarity; deal with issues by adding using namespace std;.
Program 2: Arithmetic operations – "arithmetic.cpp": Declare two ints, perform + - * / %, output results. Approach: Handle division (use double for decimal results, e.g., static_cast<double>(a)/b); ways to deal: Check for divide-by-zero with if (b != 0).
Program 3: Modulo and even/odd check – Input a number, use %2 to check even/odd, output message. Approach: Combine declaration and basic output.
Program 4: Type conversion – "conversion.cpp": Convert int to double and vice versa, print. Approach: Use explicit casting like double d = static_cast<double>(intVar);.
Program 5: Simple area calculator – Input radius (double), compute area = PI * r * r, output. Approach: Use const for PI; deal with input using cin.
Full Problems from Sites:
HackerRank: "Say 'Hello, World!' With C++" – Approach: Just output string; ways to deal: Ensure exact match for submission.
HackerRank: "Input and Output" – Approach: Read three ints with cin >> a >> b >> c, output sum; ways to deal: Handle large inputs by using int (within range).
LeetCode: "Add Two Integers" (problem 2235) – Approach: Function to return sum; ways to deal: Simple + operator.

Point-to-point: For each program, test with 3 inputs (e.g., positive, negative, zero); debug compilation errors like missing headers.

Homework/Review (30-45 minutes):
Compile and run all 5 programs again; fix any runtime errors (e.g., overflow for large ints—note to use long long later).
Journal: List 3-5 key learnings (e.g., "Variables must be declared with type"), 2 common mistakes (e.g., "Forgot to initialize variable, got garbage value"), and how to avoid them (e.g., "Always initialize to 0 or known value").
Solve additional: HackerRank "Variable Sized Arrays" intro (but skip if advanced); review GeeksforGeeks examples.
Full details: Spend 10 mins debugging one program intentionally broken (e.g., remove semicolon, note error message). Ensure you understand why code fails (e.g., undeclared variable causes compiler error).

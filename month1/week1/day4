Day 4: Loops (Advanced) and 1D Arrays
Objective: Advance loop usage with nesting and introduce arrays for grouped data storage.

Theory: Advanced Loops (45 minutes):
Nested: for inside for (e.g., 2D patterns).
Optimization: Minimize inner loop work.
Read: GeeksforGeeks loops advanced examples.

Theory: 1D Arrays (1 hour):
int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; access arr[0]-arr[4].
Iteration: for(int i=0; i<size; i++).
Read: GeeksforGeeks "Arrays in C++".

Practice (2-3 hours):
Program 1: Multiplication table – Nested for.
Program 2: Star pattern – Nested loops for triangle.
Program 3: Array sum – Input size, elements, sum.
Program 4: Max/min in array.
Program 5: Reverse array.
Full Problems:
HackerRank: "Arrays Introduction" – Approach: Read n, array, reverse print; ways: Loop backward.
LeetCode: "Running Sum of 1d Array" (1480) – Approach: Prefix sum loop.
Codeforces: "Young Physicist" (69A) – Approach: Array of vectors, sum conditionals.


Homework/Review (30-45 minutes):
Journal errors (e.g., out-of-bounds); solve extra array problems.

Day 5: Functions Basics
Objective: Break code into reusable functions for modularity.

Theory (1.5 hours):
int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; }.
Pass by value/ref (& for ref).
Read: GeeksforGeeks "Functions in C++".

Practice (2-3 hours):
Program 1: Add function.
Program 2: Prime check.
Program 3: Swap (by ref).
Full Problems:
HackerRank: "Functions" – Approach: Max of four; ways: Nested max calls.
LeetCode: "Defanging an IP Address" (1108) – Function to replace.


Homework/Review (30-45 minutes):
Refactor prior code; journal scope issues.
